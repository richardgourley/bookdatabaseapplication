# PHP Book database application
This is an easy to understand OOP single page application to help any students looking to understand the concept of Model View COntroller from scratch. 

Basically, it's a single page app where you can add book details to your database.  You can also see all of the books on the same page, and delete any book, all from the same page.

CURRENTLY, I'm updating it to become a good reference for any other developers looking for an example of a complete MVC application in PHP from scratch.
It's a work in progress and currently replacing and re-writing large sections of the app.  

SKILLS COVERED
- MVC - separation of concerns, specifically MODELS (CLASSES) and VIEWS
- Using PDO classes to connect to a MySQL database.
- Displaying database query results, inserting and deleting database items using PDO in PHP.

DESIGN SKILLS 
- MVC
- Abstract Classes
Our main class is abstract.  Every class we use in the app extends it.  
- Dependency Injection
- Single Responsibility Principle
The classes all have one responsibility in the app. This is the 'S' in solid.
- Inheritance - extended classes
- DRY - not repeating code.
