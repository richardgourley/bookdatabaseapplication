# PHP Book database application
This is a nice and easy application for students to see various concepts in action.

SKILLS COVERED
- Using PDO classes to connect to a MySQL database.
- Inserting into a database
- Delete from a database
- Update database entries
- HTML form building.

This isn't strictly an MVC (Model,View,Controller) application but it's written to help students of PHP to begin thinking about how to SEPARATE VIEWS and LOGIC.
So, everything related to views is in 1 file. 
Everything related to models is in another file.

REMEMBER:  Add your own database details where you see PDO classes being instantiated. 

NOTE FOR BEGINNERS: To set up a development environment, search online for WAMP or XAMP server. You can then replace your own 
database details and start editing and playing around with the code, adapting it to become another type of database app, as you wish!

See other lessons I will be adding on GitHub related to forms in PHP and using PDO classes within PHP.
